## Building
- This program was compiled using the Quincy 2005 C/C++ enviroment on Windows. 

##Features
- Mutiplayer tic tac toe
- [y/n] Game Start option
- A "Game Over" screen
- Game intructions with board layout
- A two dimensional array
  One for back-end score keeping and one for font-end display
- Winner and draw Announcement


###Notes...
Originally coded with switch staments, which caused a bug where players could overtake the previous turn, and while that does add and interesting twist to Tic Tac Toe, I swiched to if else staments to fix the issue. Both are posted here.
